### Bringing students and educators together with the help of video! 
Traditional qualifiers such as logistics and qualifications are not sufficient to represent teaching quality. Using the **thin-slicing effect**, students can find the right teachers for them by watching videos of teachers teaching their specialty.

**For tutors:** 
1. Upload short educational videos to showcase your teaching ability.
2. Provide more information about yourself on your profile.
3. Potential students contact you to setup a lesson.

**For students:** 
1. Browse through a catalog of videos to find a teacher that fits your vibe.
2. Checkout their profile and reviews.
3. Chat with your potential educator to setup a lesson.
